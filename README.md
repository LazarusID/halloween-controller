# Halloween Controller

Motor controller for Arduino, intended to be used in Halloween decorations.


## Dependencies

This project depends on two external projects, which are automatically included
as part of the git repository:

  - Google Test, a testing and mocking framework for C++, because this project
    will be test driven.
  - Cosa, a microcontroller interface library similar to Wiring.  It was chosen
    over the more popular Wiring because it is easier to integrate into a
    test driven build.
